                <h3>The Anchor of Hope</h3>
                <p>
                  Ten years ago, in one of the darkest times of my life, I made myself a promise: if
                  I could endure it, I would do my best to make one special dream come true.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Maybe now you are thinking of something grand, crazy, or global — but actually, it
                  wasn’t. It was about visiting one amazing place in the world and meeting someone
                  very special — someone with the biggest heart ever, who can love you
                  unconditionally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It may sound crazy, but sometimes the craziest things can become your anchor — the
                  thing that helps you stay strong even when life is hard. And this anchor for me
                  were the St. Bernards and the big dream of visiting them one day.

                  When all I needed was love, care, and support, I once saw a very old video about
                  these huge gentle giants with hearts full of love. I was totally fascinated by
                  these dogs — how loyal they are, how they love their people, how they saved
                  travelers in the Alps many years ago, and how they continue to support people even
                  now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They have no aggression, only pure love and patience. I kept coming back to this
                  feeling of kindness and always knew: when everything got better, I would do
                  everything to have one of these dogs and visit their homeland.

                <h3>From Ukraine to the Alps</h3>
                <p>
                  Actually, for a simple Ukrainian girl, it’s quite difficult — almost impossible —
                  to visit Switzerland for just a few days and enjoy the St. Bernard community.
                  There are many reasons, but the most important ones are distance and money.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But I kept my promise and my dream in mind — and after the darkest times, there
                  always comes light. When I moved to Germany, which is geographically much closer
                  to Switzerland than Ukraine, I took the first chance to make my dream come true.
                  After 12 hours on the train, I finally saw the Alps, arrived in the wonderful
                  small town of Martigny, and was ready to meet someone very special — and even walk
                  with them.

            <h3>First Steps into Barryland</h3>
            <p>
              My first impression of Switzerland was like a fairy tale. I couldn’t imagine what it
              would be like to live surrounded by mountains — the view was breathtaking, and the
              people were so kind. But when I first saw a St. Bernard dog, I was so excited — I
              laughed and cried at the same time, overwhelmed with happiness that this day had come.

                  The Barryland Museum in Martigny was small but wonderful. During our first visit,
                  there were also St. Bernard puppies, and it was so nice to meet them all — even
                  getting a gentle dog lick as a sign of love from one of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What I truly enjoyed most was the walk with a St. Bernard. It was calm, full of
                  patience and love, and I could really build a connection with Noline (the dog’s
                  name). I learned so much about these dogs, their history, and their behavior.
                  Everyone there was open and friendly, even though I struggled a bit with French.

                <p>
                  But what could be crazier than visiting Barryland just to walk and communicate
                  with St. Bernards? — Visiting Barryland twice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This year, Barryland was renovated. Now it’s a big modern complex with dogs,
                  interactive zones, and activities for both children and adults. And I was more
                  than surprised when I won a visit to Barryland on Instagram, from the official
                  partner Corncard. It wasn’t just luck — it felt like a special sign that I needed
                  to return, because I truly love this place. So miracles happen, and my second
                  visit to Barryland was just as amazing as the first.

            <h3>Keeping the Dream Alive</h3>
            <p>
              To be honest, it’s the craziest and most beautiful experience I’ve ever had. I’m so
              happy that I kept this dream alive — even when it seemed impossible. I’m happy to have
              seen both the old cozy museum and the new modern interactive center — both are
              wonderful. I’m grateful to have met the St. Bernards, and I know that one day I’ll
              take home a small puppy with a wet nose from Barryland and give him as much love as
              possible — and he’ll love me back with all his St. Bernard heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because keeping your dream alive helps you move forward, through dark and light times.
              Everything is possible — even after ten years and twelve hours on a train.
