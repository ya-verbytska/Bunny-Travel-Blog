            <p>
              We love the Alps, tasty cheese, and long walks — and we are always ready for new

            <p>
              We have already visited Switzerland twice, because our mother (the author of this
              blog) has two big loves in her heart — St. Bernard dogs and Swiss chocolate. That’s
              why she took us on her dream travel, and of course we happily hopped along!

                we met the most famous Swiss dogs — the gentle giants called St. Bernards. They told
                us about their brave history in the snowy Alps, where they once saved travelers from
                avalanches and storms.
              </p>
              <p>
                We even visited the
                <a href="https://www.barryland.ch/en/" target="_blank">Barryland Museum</a>, where
                we met the dogs in real life. Imagine: fluffy, giant friends with kind eyes, wagging
                tails, and warm hearts — we were completely in love!

                  After meeting the St. Bernards, we had to taste Switzerland’s other treasure… yes,
                  chocolate! Sweet, creamy, and so delicious that our whiskers were covered in cocoa
                  dust. No wonder our mother couldn’t resist bringing us here again and again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But Switzerland is not only about chocolate — there are so many tasty dishes to
                  try!

                      <li>
                        <strong>Fondue</strong> – Melted cheese served in a pot, where you dip bread
                        pieces using long forks. A cozy dish, perfect for sharing.

                        pickles, and sometimes cured meats.
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <strong>Rösti</strong> – A crispy potato dish, similar to hash browns,
                        originally from the German-speaking part of Switzerland.

                  <p>
                    We dipped soft bread cubes into the warm, gooey cheese and couldn’t stop
                    munching. We even got our whiskers covered in fondue — it was messy but so
                    delicious! Switzerland, you really know how to make two hungry bunnies super
                    happy!

              <h2>Interesting facts about Switzerland</h2>
              <p>
                Switzerland, with its majestic mountains, delicious chocolate, and charming furry
                friends, has become one of our favorite destinations in the world! Its warm
                hospitality, stunning nature, and tasty cuisine make it truly unique. We have also
                gathered some interesting facts about Switzerland:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Four languages in one country</strong> – Switzerland has four official
                  languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. Depending on where you travel,
                  street signs, food, and even greetings can change!
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <strong>Home of chocolate</strong> – The Swiss eat more chocolate per person than
                  any other country in the world. On average, each person eats about 10 kg of
                  chocolate a year.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <strong>The land of mountains</strong> - The Alps cover about
                  <strong><em>60% of Switzerland’s land area.</em></strong> No wonder Switzerland is
                  famous for skiing, hiking, and breathtaking mountain views.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <strong>No capital city?</strong> – Technically, Switzerland doesn’t have an
                  official capital. Bern is considered the “federal city,” but it’s not written in
                  the constitution as the capital.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <strong>Where the Red Cross was born</strong> – The famous humanitarian
                  organization, the International Committee of the Red Cross, was founded in Geneva
                  in 1863.

            <h2>Memories that stay</h2>
            <p>
              As we returned home, we couldn’t stop thinking about our Swiss adventure. What we
              remembered most were the smiles of the locals, their kindness, hugs with Saint
              Bernards, the taste of local cheese and bread, and the magical mountains all around.
            </p>
            <p>
              Switzerland is truly a place that stays in your heart and makes you want to come back
              again and again.
