          <h2>Our adventures in Switzerland</h2>
          <p>
            Hallo! We are <strong>Hansli & Heidi</strong> the adventurous bunnies who love to hop
            around the world. We have already visited Switzerland twice, because our mother (the
            author of this blog) has two big loves in her heart — St. Bernard dogs and Swiss
            chocolate. That’s why she took us on her dream travel, and of course we happily hopped
            along!

              >Martigny</a
            >
            we met the most famous Swiss dogs — the gentle giants called St. Bernards. They told us
            about their brave history in the snowy Alps, where they once saved travelers from
            avalanches and storms. We even visited the
            <a href="https://www.barryland.ch/en/" target="_blank">Barryland Museum</a>, where we
            met the dogs in real life. Imagine: fluffy, giant friends with kind eyes, wagging tails,
            and warm hearts — we were completely in love!

          <h2>The most famous foods from Switzerland</h2>
          <p>
            After meeting the St. Bernards, we had to taste Switzerland’s other treasure… yes,
            chocolate! Sweet, creamy, and so delicious that our whiskers were covered in cocoa dust.
            No wonder our mother couldn’t resist bringing us here again and again.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Switzerland is not only about chocolate — there are so many tasty dishes to try!
            Here are the most famous of them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fondue</strong> – Melted cheese served in a pot, where you dip bread pieces
              using long forks. A cozy dish, perfect for sharing.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Raclette</strong> – Melted cheese scraped over boiled potatoes, pickles, and
              sometimes cured meats.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Rösti</strong> – A crispy potato dish, similar to hash browns, originally from
              the German-speaking part of Switzerland.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <aside><strong>Bunnies’ Pick:</strong> Fondue</aside>
          <br />
          <strong>Fondue</strong> — a big pot of melted cheese where we dip bread with our little
          paws. For us, it’s the cheesiest adventure in Switzerland!

          <h2>Interesting facts about Switzerland</h2>
          <p>
            Switzerland, with its majestic mountains, delicious chocolate, and charming furry
            friends, has become one of our favorite destinations in the world! Its warm hospitality,
            stunning nature, and tasty cuisine make it truly unique. We have also gathered some
            interesting facts about Switzerland:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Four languages in one country</strong> – Switzerland has four official
              languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. Depending on where you travel, street
              signs, food, and even greetings can change!
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Home of chocolate</strong> – The Swiss eat more chocolate per person than any
              other country in the world. On average, each person eats about 10 kg of chocolate a
              year.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>The land of mountains</strong> - The Alps cover about
              <strong><em>60% of Switzerland’s land area.</em></strong> No wonder Switzerland is
              famous for skiing, hiking, and breathtaking mountain views.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>No capital city?</strong> – Technically, Switzerland doesn’t have an official
              capital. Bern is considered the “federal city,” but it’s not written in the
              constitution as the capital.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Where the Red Cross was born</strong> – The famous humanitarian organization,
              the International Committee of the Red Cross, was founded in Geneva in 1863.

          <h2>Memories That Stay</h2>
          <p>
            As we returned home, we couldn’t stop thinking about our Swiss adventure. What we
            remembered most were the smiles of the locals, their kindness, hugs with Saint Bernards,
            the taste of local cheese and bread, and the magical mountains all around. Switzerland
            is truly a place that stays in your heart and makes you want to come back again and
            again.
