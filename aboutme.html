              <h2>Hi, I’m Yana!</h2>
              <p>
                Travels have always been my dream, and through this blog, I combine my love for
                exploring new places with my passion for design and storytelling.
              </p>
              <p>
                On my travels, I’m never alone. There’s always a pair of long ears peeking out of my
                backpack — yes, you guessed it — my cute handmade bunnies. Together, we visit
                beautiful countries, discover fun facts, and taste local dishes. These little
                adventures always bring me so much joy and inspiration.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bunnies are perfect travel companions — always ready for new experiences and
                tasty treats!

              <h2>How did it start?</h2>
              <p>
                But why bunnies, and how did this idea begin? The answer is simple: I love bunnies,
                and my mom loves crocheting.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the quiet days of the pandemic, crocheting became a calming and inspiring
                hobby for her. At first, she made simple, funny bunny toys, and I started taking
                cute photos of them everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, one day, she created the first bunny couple in Ukrainian style. I took them on
                vacation and snapped some photos to show my mom that the bunnies were also having a
                good time with me. That was the
                <strong>beginning of our journey.</strong>
              </p>

            <div class="section-inner">
              <h2>How is it going now?</h2>
              <p>
                The idea of making bunnies in different styles inspired by different countries was
                so adorable — and maybe a little crazy, but nothing could stop my mom’s passion for
                crocheting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past two years, our bunny family has grown to include German, Greek,
                Spanish, Italian, Swiss, Danish, and French couples. Now, wherever I travel, I take
                these little companions along to capture special memories — and to share them with
                my mom… and with you!
