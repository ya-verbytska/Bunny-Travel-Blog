              <div>
                <h3>A tiny bunny with a big heart</h3>
                <p>
                  This is Miffy, a small little bunny. She is curious, friendly and brave. She is
                  very popular in the Netherlands and all over the world — not only among children
                  but also among adults. She may look simple and cute, but her story is deep and
                  touched me to the bottom of my heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Miffy was created by the Dutch illustrator Dick Bruna, when he told his son
                  stories about a little bunny. Then he illustrated this character and developed a
                  series of books for children. I was really surprised to find out that Miffy was
                  “born” in 1955, and this year she celebrated her 70th birthday.

                <h3>My discovery before the trip</h3>
                <p>
                  Before my travel to the Netherlands, I was familiar with Miffy (but didn’t know
                  her personal story) and thought that this character was probably created in Asia
                  (maybe because of the simple form). But you can imagine how surprised I was when,
                  before my trip to Utrecht and researching places to visit, I found out that there
                  is a Miffy Museum in Utrecht.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then I started to go deeper and discovered that Dick Bruna (Miffy’s author) was
                  from Utrecht, and he lived and worked in his studio there. And for me, as a big
                  bunny fan and a self-taught illustrator, it was a sign that I definitely must go
                  there to get inspired and feel Miffy’s vibe.
                </p>

            <div class="section-inner">
              <div>
                <h3>The real name of the little star</h3>
                <p>
                  An interesting fact is that “Miffy” is not the original name of the bunny. The
                  original name is Nijntje — short for Konijntje (meaning “bunny” in Dutch). But for
                  international readers this name was quite difficult, so “Miffy” was created too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dick Bruna drew Miffy only by hand until the end of his life. Even when modern
                  technologies were available, he put a piece of his soul and his great talent into
                  every Miffy masterpiece — and that is wonderful.

            <h3>The pride of a whole nation</h3>
            <p>
              While walking through the city of Utrecht, I was impressed by how famous and beloved
              Miffy is. Many sculptures, souvenirs, sweets in the shape of Miffy — and even a Miffy
              traffic light! My inner child was thrilled every time we met a Miffy on our way, and I
              took a lot of photos with her.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was very happy to visit Utrecht and the Netherlands. It was also a great example of
              how a country can love, highlight and preserve its heritage. I met Miffy not only in
              Utrecht, but also in The Hague’s miniature park, in Gouda, and on lots of postcards
              and souvenirs. And for me it shows how proud the Dutch are to have her as a part of
              their story.
            </p>
            <div class="mobile-only">
              <img
                src="images/Blog/Articles/Article-Miffy-01.png"
                width="389"
                alt="Statue of Miffy the rabbit wearing a red dress with blue flowers, displayed outdoors among trees in a city square"
              />
            </div>
            <h3>Why she touches us all</h3>
            <p>
              But what makes Miffy so popular and famous? I don’t know the exact answer, but I think
              it is her simplicity and cuteness. She is not just a character — she lives a typical
              child’s life in her stories: full of happiness and fear, challenges, discovering the
              world, making mistakes and growing from them. Like every child. Like every adult. And
              that makes her unique and familiar at the same time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thank you, Miffy, for being a part of my journey, for helping my inner child reflect
              and make adult conclusions, for your huge bunny heart, and for reminding me who I
              really am.
