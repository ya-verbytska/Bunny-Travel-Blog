        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Yana, the creator behind this playful travel blog. Travels have always been my
          dream, and through this blog, I combine my love for exploring new places with my passion
          for design and storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my travels, I’m never alone. There’s always a pair of long ears peeking out of my
          backpack — yes, you guessed it — my cute handmade bunnies. Together, we visit beautiful
          countries, discover fun facts, and taste local dishes. These little adventures always
          bring me so much joy and inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bunnies are perfect travel companions — always ready for new experiences and tasty
          treats!
        </p>
        <h3>How did it start?</h3>
        <p>
          But why bunnies, and how did this idea begin? The answer is simple: I love bunnies, and my
          mom loves crocheting.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the quiet days of the pandemic, crocheting became a calming and inspiring hobby for
          her. At first, she made simple, funny bunny toys, and I started taking cute photos of them
          everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, one day, she created the first bunny couple in Ukrainian style. I took them on
          vacation and snapped some photos to show my mom that the bunnies were also having a good
          time with me. That was the <strong>beginning of our journey.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>How is it going now?</h3>
        <p>
          The idea of making bunnies in different styles inspired by different countries was so
          adorable — and maybe a little crazy, but nothing could stop my mom’s passion for
          crocheting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past two years, our <a href="#Gallery"><strong>bunny family</strong></a> has
          grown to include German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Swiss, Danish, and French couples. Now,
          wherever I travel, I take these little companions along to capture special memories — and
          to share them with my mom… and with you!

          <h2>Countries</h2>
          <p>
            The bunnies and I have already visited more than
            <strong>10 countries</strong>. Each trip is a new story filled with laughter, curious
            discoveries, and, of course, delicious food.
          </p>
          <p>Every place leaves a special memory — and the bunnies love to collect them all!</p>
          <h3>Our favorite countries and adventures</h3>
          <p>
            Each country gave us new friends, fun stories, and tasty memories — from cheesy fondue
            to sweet gelato. These are our favorite adventures, and we can’t wait to share them with
            you!

            Grüezi! We hopped into the snowy Alps and met the gentle St. Bernard dogs at Barryland.
            Of course, we also tried our favorite Swiss treat — fondue!

          <p>
            Our bunnies love posing for photos wherever they travel! From snowy mountain peaks to
            sunny beaches and colorful city streets — each picture is a tiny memory of their big
            adventures.
