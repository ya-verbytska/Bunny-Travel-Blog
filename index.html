            <h2>Hi, I’m Yana!</h2>
            <p>
              Travels have always been my dream, and through this blog, I combine my love for
              exploring new places with my passion for design and storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              On my travels, I’m never alone. There’s always a pair of long ears peeking out of my
              backpack — yes, you guessed it — my cute handmade bunnies. Together, we visit
              beautiful countries, discover fun facts, and taste local dishes. These little
              adventures always bring me so much joy and inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bunnies are perfect travel companions — always ready for new experiences and tasty
              treats!
            </p>

              <h2>How did it start?</h2>
              <p>
                But why bunnies, and how did this idea begin? The answer is simple: I love bunnies,
                and my mom loves crocheting.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the quiet days of the pandemic, crocheting became a calming and inspiring
                hobby for her. At first, she made simple, funny bunny toys, and I started taking
                cute photos of them everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, one day, she created the first bunny couple in Ukrainian style. I took them on
                vacation and snapped some photos to show my mom that the bunnies were also having a
                good time with me. That was the
                <strong>beginning of our journey.</strong>
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-inner">
              <h2>How is it going now?</h2>
              <p>
                The idea of making bunnies in different styles inspired by different countries was
                so adorable — and maybe a little crazy, but nothing could stop my mom’s passion for
                crocheting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past two years, our bunny family has grown to include German, Greek,
                Spanish, Italian, Swiss, Danish, and French couples. Now, wherever I travel, I take
                these little companions along to capture special memories — and to share them with
                my mom… and with you!

              <p>
                The bunnies and I have already visited more than
                <strong>10 countries</strong>. Each trip is a new story filled with laughter,
                curious discoveries, and, of course, delicious food.
              </p>
              <p>Every place leaves a special memory — and the bunnies love to collect them all!</p>

              <p>
                Each country gave us new friends, fun stories, and tasty memories — from cheesy
                fondue to sweet gelato. These are our favorite adventures, and we can’t wait to
                share them with you!

                  We hopped into the snowy Alps and met the gentle St. Bernard dogs at Barryland. We
                  also tried our favorite Swiss treat — fondue!
